# White noise
Variable $w_t$ is a white noise if it meets only three conditions: 
- $E(w_t) = 0$,
- $Var(w_t) = \sigma^2$,
- $cov(w_t, w_s) = 0$.

Note it doesn't have to be normally distributed (then we call it "gaussian noise") - but in many cases it is. 

```{r, fig.width= 8, fig.height = 5}
set.seed(0)
white_noise = rnorm(200)
tsdisplay(white_noise, plot.type = "histogram", points = FALSE)
```

```{r}
mean(white_noise)
var(white_noise)
```

```{r}
set.seed(0) # for seed = 7 there is an accidental autocorrelation
white_noise2 = runif(200, min = -1, max = 1)
tsdisplay(white_noise2, plot.type = "histogram", points = FALSE)
```

```{r}
mean(white_noise2)
var(white_noise2) # 1/3 is a theoretical value
```
